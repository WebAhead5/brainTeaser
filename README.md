## :memo: How we've done it ?

- After planning and deciding what kind of game we are creating, we drew a sketch of the desired outcome.
- Every team member received a 2 hour mission that he should finish. 
- Merged the files and the branches together.
- Enhanced the visualizations in order to get as much as close to the vision.
- **The whole process was done using HTML, CSS &     JS.
The res and the code is public so you can have a look**:rocket:
